Spring Boot Annotations: 
So, basically annotations tell compiler meaning about the class a way to be
treated. basically, it is used to create beans like we write @component on class
to create a bean of it. ioc container will find it and add it in and whenever object of
that class is needed, it will be provided from there. It also maintains lifecycle of those bean.

If application fails to start due to component scanning exception, how you will handle it?
This issue basically occurs when you have files outside the package?

Package that is currently getting scanned. I'll also check ClassPath.

Can add some attributes in EnableAutoConfiguration?

Spring Boot Starter --> It consists of different dependencies that is needed to start
our application. It also adds tom cat server, default server.

If your project needs third library how would you add it?
I can go to spring intializer and will select dependency from there and then go to
explore option for checking it.

We can change default tom cat server as well, (another server)


Spring Boot @Profile Annotation, Like it is basically for having different 
setups either for production or test environment. (Dev/Test)

We can create different application properties file
